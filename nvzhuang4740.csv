0,Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i've also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites.,1,1,1
1,"What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a ""go-to"" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!",1,1,1
2,"Let me start off by saying i never write reviews, but feel compelled to so that no one else gets swindled into buying this beautiful one-time wear piece. i absolutely fell in love with this shirt when i bought it in the fall in black... perfect basic to wear under my new draped open vest from retailer! and perfect fit! i'm long torso-ed and long armed and always have trouble with fit. this being kind of oversized was just loose enough and long enough i could actually feel comfortable wearing it wi",1,1,1
3,"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f",0,0,0
4,Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy,1,1,1
5,"If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.",0,0,0
6,"This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.",0,0,0
7,"I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy, but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide, just awful.",0,0,0
8,I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!,0,0,0
9,"Purchased dress in blue motif. love it. it is casual and comfortable, no fuss dress. love the sexy open scoop back that is just high enough to comfortably cover my bra strap.",1,1,1
10,This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted!,1,1,0
11,"I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however, i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3, 120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin, they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.",0,0,0
12,"This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made, cozy, easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!",1,1,1
13,"The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it",0,0,1
14,"As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th",1,1,1
15,"I wanted this top since the first time i saw it. it fits perfectly in a small, as i usually wear a small or medium. it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top -i am a 36a- as it is not generously sized. it flares at the bottom, which looks quite flattering. the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style. i will wash it carefully, as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing. this is a beautiful top, and i am considering buying another in a different color. i think",1,1,1
16,"I am 5'5. 125 pounds, size 4-ish (sometimes a 4, sometimes a 6), athletic build. these pants fit great except they are pretty large around the waist, about 2 extra inches of space. i don't think the problem would be fixed by sizing down since only the waist was large. i will need to get them tailored.",1,1,1
17,"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!",1,1,1
18,This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.,1,1,1
19,"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",0,0,0
20,"I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.",1,1,1
21,"After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2"" and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!",1,1,1
22,"This is one fabulous-looking dress; however, the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up, to see if that would help, but it was still too scratchy for me.",0,0,0
23,"Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.",1,1,1
24,"The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once",1,1,1
25,"This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on, it fit great on my arms, wasn't too tight on my neck, but once it went down over my chest (36c), the dress never came back ""in"" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me, very disappointing! similar to a mumu.",0,0,0
26,"Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26, so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8,",0,0,0
27,"As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.",0,0,0
28,"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.
i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.",0,0,1
29,"I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.",1,1,1
30,I just ordered this top and i love it! it is a perfect top for fall days with a cute leather jacket.,1,1,1
31,"If it's a knock off, its of the ""poise"" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!",1,1,0
32,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",0,0,0
33,I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it,0,0,0
34,"This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...",0,0,0
35,I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.,1,0,1
36,"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2"", 110, 32-24.5-32.",1,1,1
37,Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away),0,0,0
38,"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. 

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",0,0,0
39,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,0,0,0
40,"This product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey. props on the draping though, that was lovely.",1,1,1
41,"I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom",0,0,0
42,"Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!

material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. 

fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j",1,1,1
43,The jeans are the perfect high-waisted jeans. they do not stretch out and fit perfectly. the perfect length for a heel. love them all year round.,1,1,1
44,"I love how unique this top is, especially the buttons that run on the back.
it is cut boxy, but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on. the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching on the inside is not irritating.",1,1,1
45,"I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it's going right back.",0,0,0
46,A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.,1,1,1
47,"This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri",0,0,0
48,Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!,1,1,1
49,"I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!",1,1,1
50,"Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4, 34 dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)",1,1,1
51,"If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.",1,1,1
52,"The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7"" and slim, but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing, the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant, but the top fit just fine.",1,1,1
53,I love this shirt! it is so different from most things i get but such a fun change. the colors are bright and fun! you totally do not have to be western to enjoy this shirt and it's fun for a good country dancing/party/concert too. my roommate has already asked to borrow it (as in she's wearing it at a concert as i type this!). it is incredibly comfortable! i got the xs and was kind of surprised it still felt a little big. but i kept the size to wear it half tucked or even kind of oversized. i w,1,1,1
54,"This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me.",1,1,1
55,"I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.",1,1,0
56,"Cute dress. can be worn with boots, flats, or heels. i am 5'1, 112 lbs, 34 b chest and i got this dress in size petite small. i am pear shape, with a bigger bottom, and love how dress enhances my shape! my style is more classic, but i really like this dress.",1,1,1
57,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo, it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider, which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.",1,0,1
58,"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",1,1,1
59,"The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.",0,0,0
60,The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,0,0,0
61,I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,0,0,0
62,"This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.",1,1,1
63,"I was so excited to buy this coat, since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original, and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat, and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.",0,0,0
64,"I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.",0,0,0
65,"There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a",0,0,0

67,"When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just",1,1,1
68,"I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.",1,1,1
69,It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.,1,1,1

72,"Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer",1,1,1

82,"As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!",1,1,1

quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs",1,1,1
87,After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.,0,0,0

89,Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather,1,1,1
90,"I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.",1,1,1
91,"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",0,0,0

4688,This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.,1,1,1

4691,"I ordered this in the ""chocolate"" color which is really a pinkish/taupe-brown. but i love the color; it's neutral yet not too pale, just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit, from jean shorts to a dress. i love how soft the knit is. although i worry it might be prone to snag, especially the open-weave sections. i also love that the sleeves are full length, fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill",1,1,1
